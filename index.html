    <center><h1>A STORY ABOUT MY FIRST DAY IN RUN</h1></center>
    <P>My first day in Redeemer’s University, popularly known as RUN, is a day I will never forget. It was filled with excitement, nervousness, and a sense of new beginnings. As I arrived on campus with my luggage, I could already feel the atmosphere were calm, beautiful, and full of life.

After completing my registration at the school gate, I was directed to my hostel. The sight of other students moving around with their parents and belongings made me realize that I was now part of a new community. My heart raced a little as I walked into the hostel, wondering who my roommates would be and how life in the university would feel.

Later that day, I met my roommates, they were friendly and made me feel welcome right away. We talked, laughed, and shared our expectations for the new school year. I also took a short walk around the campus. The neat environment, beautiful buildings, and peaceful surroundings made me proud to be a student of Redeemer’s University.

<p>In the evening, there was an orientation program for new students. The speakers encouraged us to stay focused, disciplined, and to always put God first. Their words inspired me and gave me confidence that I could handle whatever challenges university life would bring.

When I returned to my room that night, I felt tired but happy. My first day in RUN had been wonderful, full of new faces, new experiences, and a fresh start to an exciting journey. I knew I was exactly where I was meant to be.</P>
